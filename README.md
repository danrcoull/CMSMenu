# Magento 2 CMSMenu Editor - Drag and Drop

Allow all your Pages, Wordpress Pages (powered By FishPig) to display before or after your categories in your category menu

  - Same Structure as Categories for html output works well with Luma. 
  - Drag and Drop menu structure after been added if you need to move it. 
  - Allow multiple content types to be chosen as the url. 

Features To Do:
  - Allow Futher entities types, linked to the corresponding entity so slugs dont need updating if the url of the content is changed.
  - Intergrate with Advanced Custom Content Manager to allow custom content types to be used. 
  - Refactor current code to be cleaner.
